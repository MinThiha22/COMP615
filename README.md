# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview 
This project involves solving real-world data mining problems using machine learning techniques. It is divided into two parts:

1. Predicting the outcome of direct bank marketing campaigns using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithms.
2. Exploring various architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification tasks and usse ANN models to predict outcome of marketing.

## Dataset Information

The project uses the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains 17 attributes related to bank marketing campaigns. The target variable is whether a client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no). The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository and the full description can be found here: [Dataset source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing).

## Files Structure
- `bank_marketing_campaign_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code
- `bank.csv`: Dataset used for the project
- `bank marketing analysis report.pdf`: Detailed report of the analysis and findings

## Requirement 

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, IPython, category_encoders, mlxten

You can install the required libraries using **pip** package installer or following along the installation guide from each library documentation:

Example  
```sh
pip install pandas 
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
3. Open and run all cells in `bank_marketing_campaign_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Refer to the [bank marketing analaysis report](/bank%20marketing%20analysis%20report.pdf) for detailed explanations and results.
